# IPL Data Analysis Project

This project transforms raw IPL data into meaningful statistics. Using JavaScript, we analyze datasets on matches and deliveries to answer key questions, including match counts per year, team performance, player achievements, and bowler economies.


### Directory Explanation

- **src/**: Contains JavaScript files for each analytical function.
- **server/**: Holds backend server files if needed for API.
- **public/**: Frontend files (HTML, CSS) if a UI is included.
- **output/**: JSON files where analysis results are saved.
- **data/**: Raw IPL datasets (`matches.csv` and `deliveries.csv`).
